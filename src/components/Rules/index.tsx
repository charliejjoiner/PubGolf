							Each pub is a hole, and as such it has a par and a specified

							Your score is the number of mouthfuls for the drink.
							<br /> The par and the drink are specified on the scorecard for
							each hole.

							You must have a mixer if specified, if none is specified, then
							mixers are optional, and do not influence the score. <br />

							(unless specified).
							<br /> The course must be verified by a course referree (whoever's
							organising this excursion).
							<br />
							<br /> A stroke is defined as taking the glass to the mouth and
							drinking. <br />
							When the glass leaves your mouth, or you stop drinking, your
							stroke has finished.

							If you wish to play the hole using a drink substitution, this is

								It will also incurs a penalty.

							<br /> The substitution must be of the same drink type (i.e. a
							pint for a pint, or a spirit for a spirit) <br />
							The penalty for drink substitution is double the original drink,
							so if the drink is a pint, the penalty is 2 pints.
							<br /> The number of strokes taken for the penalty drink must be
							added to the score for the hole.

						<p className="text-sm">
							Your score for a hole is the number of strokes taken to complete
							the hole, this must be recorded on your score card. <br />
							You must also record all penalties, slip-ups and other violations
							of the rules.
							<br />
							The winner of each course is the player with the lowest score.
							<br />
							<br />
							In the event of a tie at the end of the competition the player
							with the least number of penalties will be declared the winner.
							<br /> If there is still a tie then a play-off occurs, where the
							last hole is played repeately until one player wins by two
							strokes. <br />
							Any disputes shall be settle by a commitee comprising the
							organisers and a designated referee.
							<br />
							<br /> Any drinks played outside of those required for the
							competition will not influence the score in any direct way. <br />
							Throwing up is not good but will only add two strokes to your
							score card.
